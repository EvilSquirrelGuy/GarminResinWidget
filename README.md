[Download here!](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/265aed1b-d72b-484b-8baf-c09b00e57f24?tid=0)

*Now available in the EU/EEA! ðŸŽ‰*

## Supported Models

* vÃ­voactive 5
* Forerunner 265/265S
* Venu 2/2+/2S
* Venu 3/3S

## Setup

This widget directly queries the HoYoLAB API, so you'll need to grab the following things:

* Your HoYoLAB cookies (specifically `ltoken_v2`, and `ltuid_v2`) in order to authenticate
  * [node-hoyolab](https://github.com/iseizuu/node-hoyolab) have a great tutorial on how to do this
* Your Genshin UID for the account you want to query, so the widget knows which account to query

Once you have these, you can configure them in the Garmin Connect IQ App (you'll need to have downloaded the app
from the Garmin App Store for this. Yes, setting it to beta does work, don't worry.) Cookies go in the "Authentication"
group, and your UID goes into "Account".

Make sure to spam the save button a few times since saving the configuration is a bit buggy (at least in my experience).

## Security & Privacy

In order to be able to access your Genshin data, this app needs your HoYoLAB auth tokens. Naturally, you may be weary of giving a random app
your authentication tokens, since some of you have, no doubt, spent 100s or 1000s on this game ;)

The token is only stored __on your device__, and is only sent to the **Official HoYoLAB API** endpoints. There are no middlemen, no catches,
nothing! I wouldn't want my account data stolen either. You can review [source/ResinModel.mc](source/ResinModel.mc) to see exactly what happens
to the token with web requests.

## Contributing

As this is just a small hobby project of mine, I'm not really looking for help in the core functionality (unless you happen to
be able to solve a bug faster than I can). The main ways you can help are by creating bug reports, feature requests, and (when
the time comes) translations!

Also if you really like the project, consider starring it on GitHub, or writing a quick review on the Garmin Connect IQ store
so more people can access their resin count from their wrist!
